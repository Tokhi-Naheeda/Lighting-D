# Light Me Up

In this project, I recreated a lighting animation effect that makes text appear to "glow" and change as if it's being lit up, similar to the example below. The challenge was to create the animation using **CSS keyframes** and **text-shadow** for a smooth glowing effect.

### Languages Used
- **HTML** for structuring the webpage
- **CSS** for styling and animation

### Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design a lighting animation effect for text. The key components involved are:
- Creating a custom animation called `lighting` using `@keyframes`.
- Using **`text-shadow`** to simulate the lighting effect.
- Adding **`animation-delay`** to control the timing of the effect for multiple elements.


Hereâ€™s what I did:
- Implemented the lighting animation with **CSS keyframes**.
- Used **`text-shadow`** to create the glowing effect.
- Applied **`animation-delay`** to stagger the animations of multiple text elements, making the effect more dynamic.
- Ensured the animation looked as close as possible to the provided mockup.
